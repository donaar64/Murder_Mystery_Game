This project has only been proven to work on a mac OS in JDK 21.0.4
This project should be able to run on windows in anything JDK 17 or higher (This is due to extensive use of the random.nextInt() function)
This project will not run on linux or in anything lower than JDK 16

To run this file run the Game.jar file inside of the project folder
To do this you must first unzip the file which if you are reading this must mean that you have already done. Hooray!
You must then open the terminal or command prompt. 
This will likely open in the home folder for your user. Use  the command "cd" plus a folder name to get inside of the project folder
At this point use java -jar Game.jar and the game should play
If it doesn't use java -version, this will give you the version of JDK that you are running, if this is lower than the version listed above then it will break
If attempting to run this in some other way, the main method can be found inside of the game.java file

This project relies on the names folder with all of the files inside of it being inside of the project folder which should in turn be in the Terrible-Person-Simulator folder (Buildings.txt,Classes.txt,Clubs.txt,DeathMessages.txt,FemaleFirstNames.txt,LastNames.txt,MaleFirstNames.txt)
This project will begin with the phrase "A Murder Has Occured" along with some other stuff appearing in the terminal
